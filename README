I. Adding the meta-wifi-credentials layer to your build
=================================================

Run 'bitbake-layers add-layer meta-wifi-credentials/<configuration>'

where <configuration> is one of the following:

II. Misc
========

This layer contains demo recipes used at SCALE 17 to show how to add WiFi
credentials and network management utilities in OpenEmbedded builds.
The presentation slides are available at
https://www.slideshare.net/MenderOTA/configuring-wifi-in-open-embedded-builds
and the talk can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP8Vu3PuJPc&t=125m0s.

Note that WiFi passwords are stored directly in this repo which is visible
publicly on github.com so this should not be used directly but rather serve
as a guide for how to setup a private layer for yourself.
